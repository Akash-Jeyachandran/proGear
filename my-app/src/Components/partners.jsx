I particularly want to mention Mr. Narpal, my point of contact, who was very persistent and helpful during the entire process. Overall, I have had a good experience till now.",

      "I have been using their rented car for about a month now. The car has not shown any signs of problems and was delivered to me in peak condition. I'm quite happy with it too. Narpal Singh was my point of contact with the company. He has been extremely helpful in guiding me in the process of leasing. His prompt response to any query that I had, showed a lot of professionalism and was quick to earn my trust.",
